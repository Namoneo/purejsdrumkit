#DRUM KIT PROJECT
I started learning javascript in depth and I'm following online course provided by Wes Bos. 
In this project I learned using only HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT how to create Drum kit which is awesome. 
You can check it out the result on the website : https://namoneo.github.io/purejsdrumkit/
